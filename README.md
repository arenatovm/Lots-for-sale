# Lots Website

A simple, fast static site to showcase 14 real-estate lots and capture buyer interest.

## Goals
- Public page listing all lots with photos, price/status, and map link
- Detail page (or modal) per lot
- Contact/interest form (to be wired to AWS later: API Gateway + Lambda + SES)
- Low cost, easy to maintain, CI/CD via GitHub â†’ AWS Amplify (later)

## Tech (Phase 1)
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no framework yet)
- Deployed later with AWS Amplify, connected to this GitHub repo

## Workflow
- Create feature branches, open Pull Requests, merge into `main` after review
